# Natural selection - food chains and ecosystems

Aimed to make the game's ecosystem feel more alive, immersive and semi-realistic.

The mod adds plenty of interactions between entities by modifying their behaviors, adding some and rewamping entities to make them feel more like an actual living organisms rather than just another dangerous liveforms trying to have a piece of you. Or if you just want enemies to kill eachother you can!

## Config options

Many mechanics, behaviors an settings can be toggled and tweaked with config with wide variety of options.

#### Options include:
- Toggles to enable/disable behaviors
    - Applied on loading the mod. Requires restart.
- Blacklists
    - Automatically generated on booting up the game. Requires restart.
- Debug toggles
    - Can be changed at runtime with config mods (LethalConfig, LethalSettings).
    - For better bug reports, turn the toggles on when you encounter bugs or unexpected behaviors.
